# Macaroni Cheese Toastie

**Description:**
Now this is my kind of grilled cheese sandwich! A Mac & Cheese Grilled Cheese Sandwich. This is comfort food stuffed into another comfort food and then grilled to perfection! You can boxed Mac & Cheese, white bread, and both cheddar and liquid cheese. Yeah, it’s that kind of sandwich! And my stomach is growling… 

**Ingredients:**

* 4 thick slices white farmhouse bread
* 1 tbsp grated Parmesan
* freshly ground black pepper
* 80 g macaroni
* 2 tbsp butter, at room temperature
* 1 tbsp flour
* 180 ml whole milk
* 30 g grated mature Cheddar
* pinch of English mustard powder

**How to make it**

***STEP 1:*** To make the macaroni cheese, bring a medium saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the macaroni and cook according to the packet instructions.

***STEP 2:*** Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over a medium heat, then stir in the flour to make a roux. Slowly whisk in the milk to make a smooth sauce. Cook for 3–5 minutes, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Stir in the Cheddar and mustard powder, then take off the heat. Drain the macaroni and add it to the sauce, and let it sit for 5 minutes so everything thickens up.

***STEP 3:*** Spread the remaining butter on one side of each slice of bread. Lay 2 slices of the bread butter-side down and spoon on the macaroni cheese; be careful not to overload them. If there is too much macaroni cheese to fit in the sandwiches, serve the extra on the side. Sprinkle over the Parmesan and season with black pepper, then top with the remaining slices of bread, buttered sides facing up.

***STEP 4:*** Heat a heavy-based frying pan (skillets) over a medium heat. Carefully transfer the sandwiches into the pan using a spatula. Cook them for 3 minutes on each side, gently pressing down on the bread with the spatula to aid cooking, but not too much as the macaroni may fall out. Alternatively, cook the sandwiches in a toasted sandwich maker or a panini press. The toasties are ready when the bread is golden and crispy.

***STEP 5:*** SERVE AND ENJOY!!!
