## *Ingredients* 

140g large raw peeled king prawns, from sustainable sources
1 lemon 
120g ripe cherry tomatoes, on the vine
3 medium courgettes 
1 clove of garlic 
1/2 a fresh red chilli 
extra virgin olive oil 
20g pine nuts

## *Method*

1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC.
2. Devein the prawns, then place in a mixing bowl.
3. Grate in half the lemon zest and squeeze in half the juice, then season with sea salt and black pepper.
4. Give it all a good stir, then leave to one side for the flavours to mingle while you prepare the rest of the dish.
5. Put the cherry tomatoes on a small baking tray and roast in the hot oven for 6 to 7 minutes, or until they’re starting to burst.
6. Meanwhile, use a spiralizer or julienne peeler to finely slice the courgette into long, thin strips of courgetti. Set aside.
7. Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chilli.
8. Place a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add a drizzle of oil. Tip in the sliced garlic and chilli and fry until lightly golden, then add the prawns and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes, turning regularly until nearly cooked through.
9. Place the courgetti in the pan along with the cherry tomatoes, then squeeze over the remaining lemon juice. Cook, tossing often, for 1 minute, or until everything is hot.
10. Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts in a dry pan until golden, then lightly crush.
11. Divide between plates, scatter over the crushed pine nuts, drizzle over a little oil, and serve.
