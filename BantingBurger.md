# Banting Burger

A simple grilled hamburger recipe using portobello mushroom caps as the bun for a healthy alternative to regular hamburgers.

## Recipe:

* 500g Mince
* 1 Red Onion, chopped
* 1 Egg, beaten
* 2 Tbsp Fresh Parsley
* 8 large Brown Mushrooms
* 1 Tomato, sliced
* 4 Tbsp Mayonnaise
* To fry Olive Oil
* To flavour Himalayan Salt
* To flavour Black Pepper
* 8 leaves Baby
* 1 med Chili

## Method:

1. Chop the parsley finely.

2. Tip the burger ingredients into a large mixing bowl: mince, onion, parsley, eggs, salt and pepper (optional: chilli). Mix until well combined (you can use your hands). Shape into 8 burger patties. Heat a few glugs of olive oil in a large frying pan on medium to high heat. When the oil is hot, gently lay the burger patties in the pan and fry for about 6 to 8 minutes on each side until golden. Drain on paper towels and keep warm.

3. Turn the grill on in the oven. Place the mushrooms on a baking tray. Remove the stems and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Grill for about 5 minutes on each side until done.

4. To serve, divide the mushrooms between the plates and top each with a burger patty, spinach leaf, slice of tomato and a dollop of mayonnaise.

5. You can also add some grated cheese for extra flavour.
